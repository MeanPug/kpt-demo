# Contains the "grouping object" template ConfigMap.
# When this object is applied, it is handled specially,
# storing the metadata of all the other objects applied.
# This object and its stored inventory is subsequently
# used to calculate the set of objects to automatically
# delete (prune), when an object is omitted from further
# applies. When applied, this "grouping object" is also
# used to identify the entire set of objects to delete.
#
# NOTE: The name of this grouping object template file
# (e.g. grouping-object-template.yaml) does NOT have any
# impact on group-related functionality such as deletion
# or pruning.
